# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree #

## Program Structure ##
<h3>Term 1</h3>
<h4>Computer Vision and Deep Learning</h4>
<p>In this term, you'll become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on
    automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and
    more all based on just camera data!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Project: Finding Lane Lines on the Road</li>
    <li>Project: Traffic Sign Classifier</li>
    <li>Project: Behavioral Cloning</li>
    <li>Project: Advanced Lane Finding</li>
    <li>Project: Vehicle Detection and Tracking</li>
</ul>
<h3>Term 2</h3>
<h4>Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control</h4>
<p>In this term, you'll learn how to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment and
    control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use
    these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Project: Extended Kalman Filters</li>
    <li>Project: Unscented Kalman Filters</li>
    <li>Project: Kidnapped Vehicle</li>
    <li>Project: PID Controller</li>
    <li>Project: Model Predictive Control</li>
</ul>
<h3>Term 3</h3>
<h4>Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems</h4>
<p>In this term, you'll learn how to plan where the vehicle should go, how the vehicle systems work
    together to get it there, and you'll perform a deep-dive into a concentration of your choice.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Project: Path Planning Project</li>
    <li>Project: Semantic Segmentation</li>
    <li>Project: Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System</li>
    <li>Project: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car</li>
</ul>
