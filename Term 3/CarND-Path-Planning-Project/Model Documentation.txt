Trajectory generations 

The code lines from 312 to 425 does the calculation of the trajectory based on the location coordinates, car's speed and the past path points.
Firstly, the last two points of the previous trajectory along with three points at a far distance is used as initialization for the spline calculation. 
The coordinates are then transformed to local car coordinates for spline calculation. To extend the trajectory, the passed trajectory points are copied 
to the new trajectory and the rest of the points are calculated by evaluating the spline and transforming the output coordinates to local coordinates. 
The speed component is also tweaked along every trajectory points.
